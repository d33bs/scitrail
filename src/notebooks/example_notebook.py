# # An example notebook
#
# Sharing how a notebook can work in combination with a Python package.
#
# Notes:
# - [`jupytext`](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) helps us automatically
# export the notebook through `pyproject.toml` configuration.
# This makes it easier to provide line-level comments within pull
# request reviews or to use the Python file independent of the notebook.
# - [`jupyterlab_code_formatter`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab_code_formatter)
# helps automatically format the notebook on-the-fly using black, isort, and
# more so that our notebook has a consistent and readable format
# (including as we develop it!). This extension is available through the
# browser-based Juypyter interface
# as a circular button near the top of each notebook.
# Clicking it applies the formatting to the notebook.

# show an import from a local package
from scitrail import show_message

# use the function within the notebook to show it works
show_message("Hello, notebook!")
